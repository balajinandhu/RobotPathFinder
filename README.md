# RobotPathFinder

##Problem Description:
  1. A robot must reach the end point from a start cell in the grid efficiently.
  2. The grid may contain obstacles in between.
  3. The simulator must contain a way to dynamically change the obstacles to make the algorithm adapt to the changing landscape.
  4. Avoid Bellman based algorithms.
  
###Solution:
+ The solution makes use of A* algorithm
+ The heuristic is based on Manhattan distance
+ The solution compiles on Qt Creator IDE
+ The start and end cells may be changed programatically as of now.
